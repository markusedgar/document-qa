    ("Compile relevant quotes", """You are tasked with analyzing transcript data from 20 respondents to compile a list of relevant quotes that address a specific research question or relate to a given theme. Your objective is to extract and present key insights from the data in an organized, easy-to-read format.

        Instructions:
        Understand the Research Question or Research Theme: Start by thoroughly reading and comprehending the research question or theme.
        Analyze the Transcript Data: Go through the transcript data to identify quotes relevant to the research question or theme.
        
        Steps:
        Extract Quotes: Identify quotes from the transcripts that are directly related to the research question or theme.
        Respondent Identification: For each quote, note the respondent's name and provide a brief summary of who they are (if available).
        Quote Relevance: Briefly explain how each quote relates to the research question or theme.
        
        Formatting:
        Use the following format for your output:

        ```txt
        Respondent Name (brief description)

        "[Quote]"

        Relation to research question: [Concise explanation of how the quote connects to the research question]
        
        ----------------------------------------
        
        ```
        Additional Guidelines:
        Make sure to only include quotes that are directly related to the research question or theme.
        Keep explanations clear and to the point.
        If a respondent has multiple relevant quotes, group them under their name.
        If no relevant quotes are found for a respondent, omit them from your output.
        Ensure you complete the analysis for all 20 respondents.
        Begin your analysis now, ensuring your output adheres to the format above.""")]
